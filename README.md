# ukc-client-project
Client Project app (for iOS platform only) for module "Mobile Application Design Project" during MSc degree Mobile Application Development at University of Kent Canterbury. The Clients for this projects are

- UKC Estates (https://www.kent.ac.uk/estates/)
- UKC OPERA (https://www.kent.ac.uk/studentsupport/accessibility/opera.html)

## Vision
“Ray” is an iOS application developed for Estates and OPERA within the University of Kent, which aims to be a quick and easy tool for users of all accessabilities to report issues around the university campus. The Estates department require an application where a user (staff or students) can report issues from around campus via the app, then for the report to be sent to the appropriate contact depending on where the issue is based, either Hospitality, UPP or Estates itself. The OPERA team requires the same functionality, however they would like the main focus to be on the accessibility of the application so that it is easy to use for everyone.
